## My process

### Built with
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I most learned about SASS and its functions.It was a really interesting challenge as i also learned about ::-webkit-slider-thumb which was extremely interesting.

### Continued development

I want to continue expanding my knowledge in SASS as there is a lot of interesting loop holes that i haven't learned about and to use it to its maximum potential

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://nikitahl.com/style-range-input-css#:~:text=To%20style%20the%20range%20input,selectors%20for%20the%20range%20input) - This helped me for styling the sliding thumb and making it more responsive.I learned a very short way of achieving this and this was extremely useful as it saved most of my coding time.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_range.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use and apply the different attributes of type=range concept.This is extremely helpful to anyone who wants to build an interactive and user-friendly sliding thumb.
